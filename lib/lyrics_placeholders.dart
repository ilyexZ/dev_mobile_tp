  'Because': """
Aah
Because the world is round
It turns me on
Because the world is round
Aah
Because the wind is high
It blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Aah
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue
It makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
Aah

  'The Dark Side of the Moon': """[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 3: Roger Waters & Peter Watts]
The lunatic is in my head (*laughter*)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key
And there's someone in my head, but it's not me

Eclipse
Pink Floyd
Us and Them
Pink Floyd
Brain Damage
Eminem
[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And if the cloudbursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear (Oh, woah)
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon! (Oh, oh, oh)

[Outro: Peter Watts & Patricia Watts]
I can't think of anything to say except...
*laughter*
I think it's marvellous!
*laughter*""",


  'We Will Rock You': """Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
We will, we will rock you (sing it out)
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place
We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you
Alright""",
  'Survivor / I Will Survive': """
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Oh now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on survivin' (what?)
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on surviving
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you
But I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here
Even in my years to come
I'm still gon' be here
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
And keep on surviving
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work hard (ain't no stopping now)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on surviving
On no not I
I will survive
For as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
(I'm a survivor) I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give (survivor)
And I'll survive (I'm a survivor)
I will survive (survivor) hey hey
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on survivin' (what?)
